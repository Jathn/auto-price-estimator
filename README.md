# auto-price-estimator

This project was made as part of codecademies ML/AI-engineer career-path as the final project.

## Project idea:

The main idea was to create a ML-pipeline which could take in some info about a car and predict it's price.
A ML-pipeline for predicting the price of a car could even be a very useful tool for car buyers and sellers alike, and although this model has it's fair share of
imperfectness it does a good job on cars of the price range it was trained on.

## Implementation:

So the project is mainly divided into 4 parts:

1. Loading the data, cleaning it and selecting the relevant features.
2. Taking that data and finding a good model and the correct parameters for it.
3. Proceeding with the chosen model to create a pipeline which implements the ML-workflow implemented in steps 1 & 2.
4. Creating a simple front-end app to display the model's capabilities.
